to start:
**note, that I have several random accounts (remus, p... etc on klara... will need to delete them eventually)
** also note, that the user, pdawg and database, pdawg are the same/totally cool.

sudo -i -u pdawg psql


creating table for rome csv data:
CREATE TABLE rometaxidata (taxi_id SMALLINT, ts_dt TIMESTAMP, sim_t INTEGER, sim_day_num SMALLINT, weekday_num SMALLINT, Lat1 DECIMAL(8,6), Long1 DECIMAL(8,6), x INTEGER, y INTEGER);

**note, that some random points are like 30km out, ridonculus
** table name  = rometaxidata

copying, from TMP file only for some reason (with user as postgres)
COPY rometaxidata FROM '/tmp/test_trace.csv' DELIMITER ';' CSV HEADER;
