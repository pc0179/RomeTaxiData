to start:
**note, that I have several random accounts (remus, p... etc on klara... will need to delete them eventually)
** also note, that the user, pdawg and database, pdawg are the same/totally cool.

sudo -i -u pdawg psql dbname=...


creating table for rome csv data:
CREATE TABLE rometaxidata (taxi_id SMALLINT, ts_dt TIMESTAMP, sim_t INTEGER, sim_day_num SMALLINT, weekday_num SMALLINT, Lat1 DECIMAL(8,6), Long1 DECIMAL(8,6), x INTEGER, y INTEGER);

**note, that some random points are like 30km out, ridonculus
** table name  = rometaxidata

copying, from TMP file only for some reason (with user as postgres)
COPY rometaxidata FROM '/tmp/output_trace.csv' DELIMITER ';' CSV HEADER;

COPY rometaxidata FROM '/home/pdawg/Dropbox/rome_taxi_trace_data/output_trace.csv' DELIMITER ';' CSV HEADER;

quit
\q

quering... with python3

for importing large files.... could be useful...
this is only useful if importing say one entire image, essentially just saves the pointer address to the large file object
(see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/app-psql.html)
