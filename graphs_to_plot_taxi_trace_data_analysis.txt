Taxi Trace Data Analysis.
Potential list of graphs to generate.

initial figures:
- emprical CDF distributions of delay/time interval between data points of taxi location (done per taxi then aggregated)
- number of taxis present over time/for each trace day/hour?
- after ECDF, maybe something to highlight choice of time windows and intervals.
- maybe an average speed distribution?


'Results' figures:
- number of two hop neighbours? (NoLoS vs LoS?)
- cummulative number of connections over time (compare NoLoS vs LoS)
- average locations of comms clusters?
- 'disease spreading' amongst taxis? NoLoS versus LoS conditions: give a taxi an update to send to all others, how long it takes to penetrate entire network?
- reject ratios. Important to show choice of window/sampling frequency.


Semi Random Research Questions...
- typical distance travelled before encountering another taxi? this could provide an interesting ratio between number of pedestrians (as a func. of route distance travelled) and number of oppurtunities to transfer data?
- overall distance travelled per taxi?

- how many extra taxis needed to get a big enough network? Num taxis versus disease propagation time? if more taxis present, does it spread faster? or takes longer due to high volume.

- how long to map area using different number of taxis?

- can people communicate with taxis i.e. pick two random points in a city, how long to get message across? vary with different number of taxis? How does that scale?

- where to locate road side units/ where would parked cars be most useful to aid messaging/ updates

--------------------
general notes on plots....

imagine scenario: taxiA has a message to transfer to location Z.
taxiA transmits message to every taxi it meets, until (time out?) or message reaches destination?
problem is knowing where taxis pick up and off load message to pedestrian. since I only store where they can exchange  messages...
maybe a question of getting the message at least to the nearest 'message exchange cluster'?

disease spreading protocol:
very simple, if within LoS/NoLos range, what happens to diffusion process, how long until all taxis (or a high percentage) receive the update.
- params. to vary, number of taxis (single day combined with multiple days...), where/when messaging/updating starts, how many taxis start with the message?, NoLoS/LoS ranges, pick within: 50-250m range
- defining 'total' number of taxis could be odd, since number of taxis on the road varies throughout day, see initial figures.

regards network size, simply counting areas might be silly.
Have a look at how combining taxi trace data eventuially yields to higher frequency of road visits by a taxi.
If the aim is to have a city network, spread of taxis across city is important, how often a taxi visits an area (250m*250m) is important, If I were to double number of taxis, how does this effect spread?
Do taxis just cluster around same areas, or visit more of city,
identify black spots for strategic parking/road-side-units.... 

regards lidar mapping;
image a scenario where each taxi has a roof top lidar unit, how many taxis/how long to reliably (at least 3+ passes per street?) map Rome?
how quickly can updates spread amongst taxis, as in over time, how often do they re-scan streets/areas (e.g. 1 week or every two days?)
